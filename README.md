# WeatherApp

*a practice project of mine; 
 it is mainly for me to get farmiliar with Volley, knowing how to play with APIs.
 the application itself is far from perfect, with a very limited amount of polishing.

--implemented functionalities:
>create json request to Open Weather
>fetch the current weather of designated cities (from Text user input), or the user's current positions
>locating the users cuurent postion using locationManager.
>basic UI
>play with drawable to polish the UI
