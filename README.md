# WeatherApp

*a practice project of mine; 
 it is mainly for me to get farmiliar with Volley, knowing how to play with APIs.
 the application itself is far from perfect, with a very limited amount of polishing.

--implemented functionalities:

Create json request to Open Weather.
Fetch the current weather of designated cities (from Text user input), or the user's current positions.
Locating the users cuurent postion using locationManager.
Basic UI.
Play with drawable to polish the UI.
